# OAuth 2.0 for Desktop Apps

> **Note:** If you are new to OAuth 2.0, we
> recommend that you read the
> [OAuth 2.0 overview](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) before
> getting started. The overview summarizes OAuth 2.0 flows that Google
> supports, which can help you to ensure that you've selected the right flow
> for your application.

This document explains how desktop applications (such as applications
running on Windows, macOS, or Linux, or command-line interface (CLI)
tools) use Google's OAuth 2.0 endpoints to authorize access to
Google APIs.

OAuth 2.0 allows users to share specific data with an application while
keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information
private.
For example, an application can use OAuth 2.0 to obtain permission from
users to store files in their Google Drives.

Desktop applications are installed locally on a user's machine (such as
standalone desktop software, developer CLI tools, background sync
utilities, or scripts). Because these apps are distributed to individual
devices, it is assumed that these apps cannot keep secrets (they are
public clients). They can access Google APIs while the user is actively
interacting with the app or when the app is running in the background.

This authorization flow is similar to the one used for
[web server applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server). The
main difference is that desktop apps must open the system browser and
supply a local redirect URI (such as a loopback IP address) to handle
responses from Google's authorization server.

## Libraries and samples

We recommend using the Google API Client Libraries for your programming
language (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js, Go, .NET) when implementing
OAuth 2.0 for desktop applications. The client libraries handle user
authorization and token management, making implementation simpler and less
error-prone than using the lower-level HTTP/REST endpoints directly.

For mobile apps, see the
[Android](https://developer.android.com/identity/authorization) and
[iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/api-access) authorization
guides.

For apps running on devices that don't support a system browser or that
have limited input capabilities, such as TVs, game consoles, cameras,
or printers, see
[OAuth 2.0 for TVs & Devices](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device)
or [Sign-In on TVs and Limited Input Devices](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/devices).

## Prerequisites

### Enable APIs for your project

Any application that calls Google APIs needs to enable those APIs in the
API Console.

To enable an API for your project:

1. [Open the API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) in the Google API Console.
2. If prompted, select a project, or create a new one.
3. The API Library lists all available APIs, grouped by product family and popularity.
   If the API you want to enable isn't visible in the list, use search to find it, or click
   **View All** in the product family it belongs to.
4. Select the API you want to enable, then click the **Enable** button.
5. If prompted, enable billing.
6. If prompted, read and accept the API's Terms of Service.

### Create authorization credentials

Any application that uses OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs must have
authorization credentials that identify the application to Google's OAuth 2.0
server. The following steps explain how to create credentials for your
project. Your applications can then use the credentials to access APIs that
you have enabled for that project.

1. Go to the [Clients page](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients).
2. Click **Create client**.
3. Select the **Desktop app** application type.
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the OAuth client. This name
   is displayed on your project's
   [Clients page](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients) to identify the client.
5. Click **Create**.

Your client ID and client secret are generated and displayed in the Google
Cloud console. Desktop apps are public clients and cannot keep secrets
confidential. Always use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) when requesting
authorization codes.

### Identify access scopes

Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources that it needs while also
enabling users to control the amount of access that they grant to your application. Thus, there
may be an inverse relationship between the number of scopes requested and the likelihood of
obtaining user consent.

Before you start implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization, we recommend that you identify the scopes
that your app will need permission to access.

> **Note:** Incremental authorization is not supported for installed apps or
> devices.

The [OAuth 2.0 API Scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) document contains a full
list of scopes that you might use to access Google APIs.

> If your public application uses scopes that permit access to
> certain user data, it must complete a verification process. If you see **unverified
> app** on the screen when testing your application, you must submit a
> verification request to remove it. Find out more about
> [unverified apps](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865)
> and get answers to [frequently asked questions about app verification](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914) in the Help Center.

## Obtaining OAuth 2.0 access tokens

The following steps show how your application interacts with Google's OAuth 2.0 server to obtain
a user's consent to perform an API request on the user's behalf. Your application must have that
consent before it can execute a Google API request that requires user authorization.

### Step 1: Generate a code verifier and challenge

Google supports the [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)
(PKCE) protocol to make the installed app flow more secure. A unique code verifier is created for every
authorization request, and its transformed value, called "code_challenge", is sent to the
authorization server to obtain the authorization code.

#### Create the code verifier

A `code_verifier` is a high-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved
characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "_" / "~", with a minimum length of 43 characters
and a maximum length of 128 characters.

The code verifier should have enough entropy to make it impractical to guess the value.

#### Create the code challenge

Two methods of creating the code challenge are supported.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Code Challenge Generation Methods</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>S256 (recommended)</b></td><td>The code challenge is the Base64URL (with no padding) encoded SHA256 hash of the code verifier.<br> <pre>
<code>code_challenge</code> = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(<code>code_verifier</code>)))</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>plain</b></td><td>The code challenge is the same value as the code verifier generated above.<br> <pre>
<code>code_challenge</code> = <code>code_verifier</code></pre></td></tr>
</table>

### Step 2: Send a request to Google's OAuth 2.0 server

To obtain user authorization, send a request to Google's authorization server at
`https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`. This endpoint handles active session lookup,
authenticates the user, and obtains user consent. The endpoint is only accessible over SSL, and it
refuses HTTP (non-SSL) connections.

The authorization server supports the following query string parameters for installed
applications:

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Parameters</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>client_id</code></td><td><strong>Required</strong> <p>The client ID for your application. You can find this value in the Cloud Console <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients">Clients page</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>redirect_uri</code></td><td><strong>Required</strong> <p>Determines how Google's authorization server sends a response to your app. There are several redirect options available to installed apps, and you will have set up your <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#creatingcred">authorization credentials</a> with a particular redirect method in mind.</p> <p>The value must exactly match one of the authorized redirect URIs for the OAuth 2.0 client, which you configured in your client's Cloud Console <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients">Clients page</a>. If this value doesn't match an authorized URI, you will get a <code>redirect_uri_mismatch</code> error.</p> <p>The table shows the appropriate <code>redirect_uri</code> parameter value for each method:</p> <table><thead><tr><th colspan="2"><code>redirect_uri</code> values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Custom URI scheme</strong></td><td><code><var>com.example.app</var>:<var>redirect_uri_path</var></code> <p>or</p> <code><var>com.googleusercontent.apps.123</var>:<var>redirect_uri_path</var></code> <ul><li><var>com.example.app</var> is the reverse DNS notation of a domain under your control. The custom scheme must contain a period to be valid.</li> <li><var>com.googleusercontent.apps.123</var> is the reverse DNS notation of the client ID.</li> <li><var>redirect_uri_path</var> is an optional path component, such as <code>/oauth2redirect</code>. Note that the path should begin with a single slash, which is different from regular HTTP URLs.</li></ul> <blockquote><b>Note</b> : Custom URI schemes are no longer supported on Android and Chrome apps. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_custom-scheme">Learn more</a> about custom scheme alternatives.</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Loopback IP address</strong></td><td><code>http://127.0.0.1:<var>port</var></code> or <code>http://[::1]:<var>port</var></code> <p>Query your platform for the relevant loopback IP address and start an HTTP listener on a random available port.

<tr><td><code>response_type</code></td><td><strong>Required</strong> <p>Determines whether the Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint returns an authorization code.</p> <p>Set the parameter value to <code>code</code> for installed applications.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>scope</code></td><td><strong>Required</strong> <p>A space-delimited list of scopes that identify the resources that your application could access on the user's behalf.

Thus, there is an inverse relationship between the number of scopes requested and the likelihood of obtaining user consent.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>code_challenge</code></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong> <p>Specifies an encoded <code>code_verifier</code> that will be used as a server-side challenge during authorization code exchange.

<tr><td><code>code_challenge_method</code></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong> <p>Specifies what method was used to encode a <code>code_verifier</code> that will be used during authorization code exchange. This parameter must be used with the <code>code_challenge</code> parameter. The value of the <code>code_challenge_method</code> defaults to <code>plain</code> if not present in the request that includes a <code>code_challenge</code>. The only supported values for this parameter are <code>S256</code> or <code>plain</code>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>state</code></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong> <p>Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your authorization request and the authorization server's response. The server returns the exact value that you send as a <code>name=value</code> pair in the URL fragment identifier (<code>#</code>) of the <code>redirect_uri</code> after the user consents to or denies your application's access request.</p> <p>You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application, sending nonces, and mitigating cross-site request forgery. Since your <code>redirect_uri</code> can be guessed, using a <code>state</code> value can increase your assurance that an incoming connection is the result of an authentication request. If you generate a random string or encode the hash of a cookie or another value that captures the client's state, you can validate the response to additionally ensure that the request and response originated in the same browser, providing protection against attacks such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">cross-site request forgery</a>. See the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#createxsrftoken">OpenID Connect</a> documentation for an example of how to create and confirm a <code>state</code> token.</p> <blockquote><b>Important:</b> The OAuth client must prevent CSRF as called out in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">OAuth2 Specification</a>. One way to achieve this is by using the <code>state</code> parameter to maintain state between your authorization request and the authorization server's response.</blockquote></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>login_hint</code></td><td><strong>Optional</strong> <p>If your application knows which user is trying to authenticate, it can use this parameter to provide a hint to the Google Authentication Server.

</table>

> **Note:** incremental authorization with installed apps is not supported due
> to the fact that the client cannot keep the `client_secret` confidential.

#### Sample authorization URLs

The tabs below show sample authorization URLs for the different redirect URI options.

The URLs are identical except for the value of the `redirect_uri` parameter. The URLs
also contain the required `response_type` and `client_id` parameters as well
as the optional `state` parameter. Each URL contains line breaks and spaces for
readability.

### Custom URI scheme

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
 scope=email%20profile&
 response_type=code&
 state=security_token%3D138r5719ru3e1%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Foauth2.example.com%2Ftoken&
 redirect_uri=com.example.app%3A/oauth2redirect&
 client_id=client_id
```

### Loopback IP address

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
 scope=email%20profile&
 response_type=code&
 state=security_token%3D138r5719ru3e1%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Foauth2.example.com%2Ftoken&
 redirect_uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A9004&
 client_id=client_id
```

### Step 3: Google prompts user for consent

In this step, the user decides whether to grant your application the requested access. At this
stage, Google displays a consent window that shows the name of your application and the Google API
services that it is requesting permission to access with the user's authorization credentials and
a summary of the scopes of access to be granted. The
user can then consent to grant access to one or more scopes requested by your application or
refuse the request.

Your application doesn't need to do anything at this stage as it waits for the response from
Google's OAuth 2.0 server indicating whether any access was granted. That response is explained in
the following step.

#### Errors

Requests to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint may display user-facing error messages
instead of the expected authentication and authorization flows. Common error codes and suggested
resolutions are:

##### `admin_policy_enforced`

The Google Account is unable to authorize one or more scopes requested due to the policies of
their Google Workspace administrator. See the Google Workspace Admin help article
[Control which third-party & internal apps access Google Workspace data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227)
for more information about how an administrator may restrict access to all scopes or sensitive and
restricted scopes until access is explicitly granted to your OAuth client ID.

##### `disallowed_useragent`

The authorization endpoint is displayed inside an embedded user-agent disallowed by Google's
[OAuth 2.0 Policies](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/policies#browsers).

iOS and macOS developers may encounter this error when opening authorization requests in
[`WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview).
Developers should instead use iOS libraries such as
[Google Sign-In for iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios) or OpenID Foundation's
[AppAuth for iOS](https://openid.github.io/AppAuth-iOS/).

Web developers may encounter this error when an iOS or macOS app opens a general web link in
an embedded user-agent and a user navigates to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint from
your site. Developers should allow general links to open in the default link handler of the
operating system, which includes both
[Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/)
handlers or the default browser app. The
[`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)
library is also a supported option.

##### `org_internal`

The OAuth client ID in the request is part of a project limiting access to Google Accounts in a
specific
[Google Cloud Organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations).
For more information about this configuration option see the
[User type](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type)
section in the Setting up your OAuth consent screen help article.

##### `deleted_client`

The OAuth client being used to make the request has been deleted. Deletion can happen manually
or automatically in the case of
[unused clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257#unused-client-deletion). Deleted clients can be restored within 30 days of the deletion.
[Learn more](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257#delete-oauth-clients).

##### `invalid_grant`

If you are using a
[code verifier and
challenge](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#step1-code-verifier), the `code_callenge` parameter is invalid or missing. Ensure that the
`code_challenge` parameter is set correctly.

[When refreshing an access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#offline), the token may have expired or has
been invalidated.
Authenticate the user again and ask for user consent to obtain new tokens. If you are continuing
to see this error, ensure that your application has been configured correctly and that you are
using the correct tokens and parameters in your request. Otherwise, the user account may have
been deleted or disabled.

##### `redirect_uri_mismatch`

The `redirect_uri` passed in the authorization request does not match an authorized
redirect URI for the OAuth client ID. Review authorized redirect URIs in the
Google Cloud Console
[Clients page](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients).

The passed `redirect_uri` may be invalid for the client type.

The `redirect_uri` parameter may refer to the OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow that has
been deprecated and is no longer supported. Refer to the
[migration guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/oob-migration) to update your
integration.

##### `invalid_request`

There was something wrong with the request you made. This could be due to a number of reasons:

- The request was not properly formatted
- The request was missing required parameters
- The request uses an authorization method that Google doesn't support. Verify your OAuth
  integration uses a recommended integration method
- An unsupported custom scheme was used for the redirect uri. If you see the error message **Custom URI scheme is not supported on Android or Chrome apps**,
  [learn more](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_custom-scheme) about custom URI scheme
  alternatives.

### Step 4: Handle the OAuth 2.0 server response

The manner in which your application receives the authorization response depends on the
[redirect URI scheme](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#creatingcred) that it uses. Regardless of the scheme, the
response will either contain an authorization code (`code`) or an error
(`error`). For example, `error=access_denied` indicates that the user
declined the request.

If the user grants access to your application, you can exchange the authorization code for an
access token and a refresh token as described in the next step.

### Step 5: Exchange authorization code for refresh and access tokens

To exchange an authorization code for an access token, call the
`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` endpoint and set the following parameters:

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Fields</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>client_id</code></td><td>The client ID obtained from the Cloud Console <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients">Clients page</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>client_secret</code></td><td><strong>Optional</strong> <p>The client secret obtained from the Cloud Console <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients">Clients page</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>code</code></td><td>The authorization code returned from the initial request.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>code_verifier</code></td><td>The code verifier you created in <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#step1-code-verifier">Step 1</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>grant_type</code></td><td><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3">As defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification</a>, this field's value must be set to <code>authorization_code</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>redirect_uri</code></td><td>One of the redirect URIs listed for your project in the Cloud Console <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients">Clients page</a> for the given <code>client_id</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

While the use of DPoP is optional, it is recommended for increased security.
The security of DPoP relies on the private key being restricted to a single device; we recommend
storing it in a way that it cannot be copied off-device, for example by using TPMs, Secure
Enclaves, or other hardware-backed keystores.
To use DPoP, your application must generate a new, unique DPoP proof JWT for each request to
the token endpoint and add it as a HTTP request header.

| Header | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DPoP` | Optional | A [DPoP proof](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9449) is a JWT that proves the possession of a private key. This is a header, not a parameter. If provided, the returned tokens are bound to this key. A new, unique proof must be generated for each request and must include `htm` (HTTP method) and `htu` (HTTP URI) claims that match the request. |

The following snippet shows a sample request:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: oauth2.googleapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ0eXAiOiJkcG9wK2p3dCIsImFsZyI6IkVTMjU2IiwiandrIjp7Imt0eSI6Ik\

code=4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7&
client_id=your_client_id&
redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:9004&
grant_type=authorization_code
```

#### Construct a DPoP proof

The following steps show how to construct a DPoP proof using OpenSSL from the command line:

1. **Generate an EC P-256 key pair:**

   ```
   openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out dpop_private.pem
   openssl ec -in dpop_private.pem -pubout -out dpop_public.pem
   ```
2. **Create the DPoP header:**

   The header must include the `typ`, `alg`, and
   `jwk` (public key) claims. The `x` and `y`
   values are the Base64Url-encoded coordinates of your EC public key.
   Base64Url encode this JSON:

   ```
   {
     "typ":"dpop+jwt",
     "alg":"ES256",
     "jwk": {
       "kty":"EC",
       "x":"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_X",
       "y":"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_Y",
       "crv":"P-256"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Create the DPoP payload:**

   The payload must include `jti` (a unique identifier for the request),
   `htm` (HTTP method, e.g., `POST`), `htu`
   (HTTP URI, e.g., `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`), and
   `iat` (issued at time). If you received a nonce from the server in a
   `DPoP-Nonce` header on the response to a previous request, you must include that
   nonce value in a `nonce` claim. The nonce claim is optional for authorization
   code exchanges and used only when the DPoP-Nonce header was previously received.
   Base64Url encode this JSON:

   ```
   {
     "jti":"JTI_VALUE",
     "htm":"POST",
     "htu":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
     "iat":YOUR_JWT_ISSUED_TIME,
     "nonce":"SERVER_PROVIDED_NONCE"
   }
   ```

   The `jti` value depends on the type of exchange:

   - For **authorization code exchanges**, the `jti` must be the
     Base64Url-encoded SHA256 hash of the authorization code:
     `"jti":"BASE64URL(SHA256(AUTHORIZATION_CODE))"`.
   - For **refresh token exchanges**, the `jti` must be a unique
     per-request identifier:
     `"jti":"YOUR_UNIQUE_PER_REQUEST_IDENTIFIER"`.
4. **Sign the proof:**

   Concatenate the encoded header and payload with a period (`.`),
   then sign the result with your private key using ES256. Note that JWS
   requires the signature to be in a raw `R | S` concatenated
   format (64 bytes for P-256). If using OpenSSL directly, you must convert
   the default ASN.1 DER-encoded signature to this raw format.

A **successful exchange** is indicated by a `200 OK`
response containing the tokens. If a valid DPoP proof is used during
the exchange, the refresh token Google returns will be DPoP-bound to your key, but access tokens
won't be DPoP bound. Access tokens will retain the `token_type` of
`Bearer` rather than `DPoP`.
Additionally, Google returns a `DPoP-Nonce` HTTP header in the response.
Your client must cache this nonce and include it in the `nonce` claim of the DPoP proof
in subsequent requests (such as when exchanging a refresh token for a new access token, or when
calling DPoP-protected APIs). By using this early-issued nonce, you can avoid an extra round-trip
failure (`use_dpop_nonce`) on your next request.

DPoP proofs must be included for token exchange requests made with DPoP-bound refresh tokens.

A **failed exchange** occurs if the `DPoP` header is
missing when expected, invalid, or if the proof uses a different key than the
one bound to the token. In these cases, the server returns a
`400 Bad Request` error.
If the DPoP proof has mismatching `htm` or `htu` claims, an expired
`iat`, a re-used `jti`, or an invalid signature, Google returns an
`invalid_dpop_proof` error code.
If a DPoP nonce is required, such as during a refresh token exchange, and the DPoP proof is
missing a `nonce` claim, or the nonce value is unacceptable to the server (e.g., it
is expired, has already been used, or is incorrect), Google returns a `use_dpop_nonce`
error code along with a `DPoP-Nonce` HTTP header containing a new nonce that you can
use in a subsequent request.
Other failures might return `invalid_grant`.

Google responds to this request by returning a JSON object that contains a short-lived access
token and a refresh token.

The response contains the following fields:

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Fields</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>access_token</code></td><td>The token that your application sends to authorize a Google API request.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>expires_in</code></td><td>The remaining lifetime of the access token in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>id_token</code></td><td><b>Note:</b> This property is only returned if your request included an identity scope, such as <code>openid</code>, <code>profile</code>, or <code>email</code>. The value is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains digitally signed identity information about the user.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>refresh_token</code></td><td>A token that you can use to obtain a new access token. Refresh tokens are valid until the user revokes access or the refresh token expires.

### Step 6: Check which scopes users granted

When requesting **multiple** permissions (scopes), users may not grant your app access to
all of them. Your app must verify which scopes were actually granted and gracefully handle
situations where some permissions are denied, typically by disabling the features that rely
on those denied scopes.

However, there are exceptions. Google Workspace Enterprise apps with
[domain-wide delegation of authority](https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106),
or apps marked as
[Trusted](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227#zippy=%2Cchange-access-from-the-app-list),
bypass the granular permissions consent screen. For these apps, users won't see the
granular permission consent screen. Instead, your app will either receive all requested
scopes or none.

For more detailed information, see
[How to handle granular permissions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/granular-permissions).

To check whether the user has granted your application access to a particular scope,
exam the `scope` field in the access token response. The scopes of access granted by
the access_token expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings.

For example, the following sample access token response indicates that the user has granted your
application access to the read-only Drive activity and Calendar events permissions:

```
  {
    "access_token": "1/fFAGRNJru1FTz70BzhT3Zg",
    "expires_in": 3920,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly",
    "refresh_token": "1//xEoDL4iW3cxlI7yDbSRFYNG01kVKM2C-259HOF2aQbI"
  }
```

## Call Google APIs

After your application obtains an access token, you can use the token to make calls to a Google
API on behalf of a given
user account if the scope(s) of access required by the API have been granted. To do this, include
the access token in a request to the API by including either an `access_token` query
parameter or an `Authorization` HTTP header `Bearer` value. When possible,
the HTTP header is preferable, because query strings tend to be visible in server logs. In most
cases you can use a client library to set up your calls to Google APIs (for example, when
[calling the Drive Files API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v2/reference#Files)).

You can try out all the Google APIs and view their scopes at the
[OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).

#### HTTP GET examples

A call to the
[`drive.files`](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/list)
endpoint (the Drive Files API) using the `Authorization: Bearer` HTTP
header might look like the following. Note that you need to specify your own access token:

```
GET /drive/v2/files HTTP/1.1
Host: www.googleapis.com
Authorization: Bearer access_token
```

Here is a call to the same API for the authenticated user using the `access_token`
query string parameter:

```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files?access_token=access_token
```

#### `curl` examples

You can test these commands with the `curl` command-line application. Here's an
example that uses the HTTP header option (preferred):

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer access_token" https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files
```

Or, alternatively, the query string parameter option:

```
curl https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files?access_token=access_token
```

## Refresh an access token

Access tokens periodically expire and become invalid credentials for a related API request. You
can refresh an access token without prompting the user for permission (including when the user is
not present) if you requested offline access to the scopes associated with the token.

To refresh an access token, your application sends an HTTPS `POST`
request to Google's authorization server (`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`) that
includes the following parameters in the request body:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `client_id` | The client ID obtained from the [API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). |
| `client_secret` | **Optional** The client secret obtained from the [API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). (The `client_secret` is not applicable to requests from clients registered as Android, iOS, or Chrome applications.) |
| `grant_type` | As [defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6), this field's value must be set to `refresh_token`. |
| `refresh_token` | The refresh token returned from the authorization code exchange. |

While the use of DPoP is optional, it is recommended for increased security.
To use DPoP with a refresh token, your application must generate a new, unique DPoP proof JWT
for each request to the token endpoint. This proof must be signed with the same private key that
was used during the initial authorization code exchange. Your application adds the proof as a
HTTP request header.

| Header | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DPoP` | Optional | A [DPoP proof](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9449) is a JWT that proves the possession of a private key. This is a header, not a parameter. If provided, the returned tokens are bound to this key. A new, unique proof must be generated for each request and must include `htm` (HTTP method) and `htu` (HTTP URI) claims that match the request. |

The following snippet shows a sample request:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: oauth2.googleapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: DPOP_PROOF_JWT

client_id=your_client_id&
refresh_token=refresh_token&
grant_type=refresh_token
```

To use DPoP with a refresh token, you must generate a new, unique DPoP proof JWT
for the request. See [Construct a DPoP proof](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#constructing-dpop-proof)
for step-by-step instructions on generating the key pair and constructing the JWT.

A **successful exchange** is indicated by a `200 OK`
response containing a new access token. When DPoP is used, the
`token_type` is `Bearer`. A successful response confirms
the DPoP proof for the refresh token was accepted. Google may also return a new
`DPoP-Nonce` HTTP header in the response; if returned, your client must cache this
nonce and include it in the `nonce` claim of the DPoP proof in subsequent requests.

A **failed exchange** occurs if the `DPoP` header is missing, invalid, or uses an incorrect key. For details on specific DPoP error codes and handling nonces, see [Failed exchange](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#failed-exchange-errors).

The following snippet shows a sample successful response headers and body when DPoP is used:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
DPoP-Nonce: AN3XwJjZsjnb0ZuWkRlek8QU7wY-Zhf-5IP6tO0tORz0KgtDT1Bo8FX-w4nz3r5lnepI

{
  "access_token": "1/fFAGRNJru1FTz70BzhT3Zg",
  "expires_in": 3920,
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Note that there are limits on the number of refresh tokens that will be issued; one limit per
client/user combination, and another per user across all clients. You should save refresh tokens
in long-term storage and continue to use them as long as they remain valid. If your application
requests too many refresh tokens, it may run into these limits, in which case older refresh tokens
will stop working.

## Token revocation

In some cases a user may wish to revoke access given to an application. A user can revoke access
by visiting [Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions). See the
[Remove
site or app access section of the Third-party sites & apps with access to your account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521#remove-access)
support document for more information.

It is also possible for an application to programmatically revoke the access given to it.
Programmatic revocation is important in instances where a user unsubscribes, removes an
application, or the API resources required by an app have significantly changed. In other words,
part of the removal process can include an API request to ensure the permissions previously
granted to the application are removed.

To programmatically revoke a token, your application makes a request to
`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke` and includes the token as a parameter:

```
curl -d -X -POST --header "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke?token={token}
```

The token can be an access token or a refresh token. If the token is an access token and it has a
corresponding refresh token, the refresh token will also be revoked.

If the revocation is successfully processed, then the HTTP status code of the response is
`200`. For error conditions, an HTTP status code `400` is returned along
with an error code.

> **Key Point:** Revocation removes all OAuth 2.0 scopes previously granted to a project, invalidating any issued access or refresh tokens for all clients registered under that project.

> **Note:** Following a successful revocation response, it might take some
> time before the revocation has full effect.

## App redirect methods

### Custom URI scheme

Custom URI schemes are a form of deeplinking that use a custom-defined scheme to open your app.

> **Important:** Custom URI schemes are no longer supported due to the risk of app
> impersonation.

#### Alternative to using custom URI schemes on Chrome apps

Use the
[Chrome Identity API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/tut_oauth/)
which delivers the OAuth 2.0 response directly to your app, eliminating the need for a
redirect URI.

### Loopback IP address (macOS, Linux, Windows desktop)

> **Important:** The loopback IP address redirect option is
> DEPRECATED for **Android**, **Chrome app** and **iOS** OAuth client types.
> Review the [loopback IP
> address migration guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/loopback-migration) for instructions on how to migrate to a supported alternative.

To receive the authorization code using this URL, your application must be listening on the
local web server. That is possible on many, but not all, platforms. However, if your platform
supports it, this is the recommended mechanism for obtaining the authorization code.

When your app receives the authorization response, for best usability it should respond by
displaying an HTML page that instructs the user to close the browser and return to your app.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Recommended usage** | macOS, Linux, and Windows desktop apps |
| **Form values** | Set the application type to **Desktop app**. |

> **Note:** See the
> [`redirect_uri`](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#request-parameter-redirect_uri) parameter definition for
> more information about the loopback IP address. It is also possible to use
> `localhost` in place of the loopback IP, but this configuration may cause issues with
> client firewalls. Most, but not all, firewalls allow loopback communication.

### Manual copy/paste (Deprecated)

> **Important:** The manual copy/paste option, also referred to as an
> out of band (OOB) redirect method, is
> [no longer supported](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html).
> Review the [OOB migration guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/oob-migration)
> for instructions on how to migrate to a secure alternative.

## Protect your apps

### Verify app ownership for Chrome

You can verify ownership of your application to reduce the risk of app impersonation.

To complete the verification process, you would use your Chrome Web Store Developer account.
The following requirements must be met for a successful verification:

- You must have a registered item in the
  [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/)
  with the same item ID as the Chrome Extension OAuth client you are completing the
  verification for.
- You must be a publisher for the Chrome Web Store item.
  [Learn more](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/group-publishers/)
  about access management in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.

In the **Verify App Ownership** section of the Chrome Extension client, click
the **Verify Ownership** button to complete the verification process.

**Note:** Wait a few minutes before completing the verification process after
granting access to your account.

If the verification is successful, a notification will be displayed to confirm the success
of the verification process. Otherwise, an error prompt will be shown.

To fix a failed verification, try the following:

- Make sure there is a registered item in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard with the
  same item ID as the Chrome Extension OAuth client you are completing the verification for.
- Make sure you are a publisher for the app, that is, you must either be the individual
  publisher of the app or a member of the group publisher of the app.
  [Learn more](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/group-publishers/)
  about access management in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
- If you just updated your group publisher list, verify that the group publisher membership
  list is synced in the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
  [Learn more](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/group-publishers/#adding-developers-to-or-removing-them-from-the-group-publisher)
  about syncing your publisher membership list.

## Time-based access

Time-based access allows a user to grant your app access to their data for a limited duration
to complete an action. Time-based access is available in select Google products during the consent
flow, giving users the option to grant access for a limited period of time. An example is the
 [Data Portability API](https://developers.google.com/data-portability) which enables a
one-time transfer of data.

When a user grants your application time-based access, the refresh token will expire after the
specified duration. Note that refresh tokens may be invalidated earlier under specific
circumstances; see [these cases](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration) for
details. The `refresh_token_expires_in` field returned in the
[authorization code
exchange](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#httprest_3) response represents the time remaining until the refresh token expires in such cases.

## Further Reading

The IETF Best Current Practice [OAuth 2.0 for
Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252) establishes many of the best practices documented here.

## Implement Cross-Account Protection

An additional step you should take to protect your users' accounts is implementing Cross-Account
Protection by utilizing Google's Cross-Account Protection Service. This service lets you
subscribe to security event notifications which provide information to your application about
major changes to the user account. You can then use the information to take action depending on
how you decide to respond to events.

Some examples of the event types sent to your app by Google's Cross-Account Protection Service are:

- `https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/sessions-revoked`
- `https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/oauth/event-type/token-revoked`
- `https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/account-disabled`

See the
[Protect user accounts with Cross-Account Protection page](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/risc)
for more information on how to implement Cross Account Protection and for the full list of available events.

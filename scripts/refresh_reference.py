"""Refresh the packaged reference data from upstream (``/refresh-reference-data``).

Every list in ``LISTS``, ``ID_LISTS`` or ``TABLES`` is fetched through the layer-1
wrappers in ``api/``, never through a task that might answer from the package; once all
are fetched, each is written to ``reference/<name>.json`` by ``PackagedList.write``: the
list's name, the upstream operation it came from, the UTC time of the fetch to the second
and upstream's records under upstream's field names (``dump_upstream``), a value list as
records of one field named by the list (conventions §3). ``TABLES`` are packaged without
an enum. Then ``enums.py`` is regenerated from the packaged files by one
``xippios.core.reference.render_enums`` call, a ``StrEnum`` per value list in ``LISTS``
and an ``IntEnum`` per list of integer ids and names in ``ID_LISTS`` (``id_name_pairs``),
so that a member compares equal to the id in upstream's data, each class naming the day
its list was fetched; and formatted with ``ruff format`` and ``ruff check --fix``, as it
is committed (ADR-0008). Where a member name derives to nothing, or two collide, name it
by hand in ``render``'s call: ``render_enums(member_names=...)``, per list and value (an
id for an ``IntEnum``).

Only lists that are the same for every caller are packaged; a multi-tenant source
packages no tenant data (ADR-0014). Run from the repository root, with whatever the list
endpoints need in the environment (a key only where they take one)::

    uv run python scripts/refresh_reference.py

``--render-only`` regenerates ``enums.py`` from the packaged ``reference/*.json`` alone,
without a request and without a key: after a core release changes the renderer
(conventions §15, item 6), it changes ``enums.py`` and nothing else.

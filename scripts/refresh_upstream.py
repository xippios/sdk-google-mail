"""Refresh the upstream documentation snapshot in ``docs/upstream/`` (``/refresh-upstream``).

The template's skeleton of a capture script. A source fills ``PAGES``, ``SPEC_URL`` where
its documentation names a machine-readable API document, ``ATTRIBUTION``, ``CAPTURE`` and,
where a page is not kept as fetched, ``reduce``, and rewrites this paragraph to say what it
captures; the rest is the family's capture frame. Until ``PAGES`` or ``SPEC_URL`` is
filled, the script refuses to run.

Everything is fetched before anything is written, one request at a time after a pause,
each URL retried at most once after a network error or a 5xx. Each page with a file is
written under ``docs/upstream/``, and ``FETCHED.md`` is regenerated whole: the UTC time of
the run with an explicit ``Z``, the attribution, and one row per page with its HTTP
status, the size and sha256 of the body as fetched, and its ETag and Last-Modified where
sent. A page recorded without a file (a 403 or a 404, a page without documentation text)
has a row of its own, and a file cut from a shared document keeps the whole document's
size and sha256 in its row (conventions §3). Files the run does not produce are removed
from the subdirectories it writes to; nothing else under ``docs/upstream/`` is touched.
Every run stops, before writing, when a page states a copyright, a licence or terms of use
that ``ATTRIBUTION`` does not record. No key is needed or read. Run from the repository
root::

    uv run scripts/refresh_upstream.py            # fetch, then write the snapshot
    uv run scripts/refresh_upstream.py --check    # fetch and compare; write nothing

``--check`` exits 1 when the snapshot differs from what upstream serves now, ``Fetched``
aside. Where the documentation is HTML, ``reduce`` converts it to Markdown with
``markdownify``, the one converter a capture script may declare: in the ``# /// script``
block above, ``dependencies = ["markdownify==X.Y.Z"]``, and at the same pin in the dev
group of ``pyproject.toml``, so that ``mypy --strict`` reads its types.
